<h4>Population Growth - Explained</h4>

Population growth is the increase in the number of people in a population or dispersed group.<br><span>(Or)<br><span>Population 
growth is the increase in the number of living beings on Earth. For most of human history our population size was relatively stable. But 
with innovation and industrialization, energy, food, water, and medical care became more available and reliable. Consequently, global 
human population rapidly increased, and continues to do so, with dramatic impacts on global climate and ecosystems. We will need 
technological and social innovation to help us support the world’s population as we adapt to and mitigate climate and environmental 
changes.

<h4>Population Growth - Calculation</h4>

<p>
When determining whether a population is overpopulated a variety of factors must be looked at. Given the complexity of the issue, 
scientists and wildlife managers often differ in judging such claims. In many cases scientists will look to food sources and living space 
to gauge the abundance of a species in a particular area. National parks collect extensive data on the activities and quality of the 
environment they are established in. This data can be used to track whether a specific species is consuming larger amounts of their 
desired food source over time.

<p>
This is done typically in four ways, the first being "total counting". Researchers will use aerial photography to count large populations 
in a specific area such as deer, waterfowl, and other "flocking" or "herd" animals. Incomplete counts involve counting a small 
subsection of a population and extrapolating the data across the whole area. This method will take into account the behavior of the 
animals such as how much territory a herd may cover, the density of the population, and other potential factors that may come into 
question. 
</p>
<p>
The third method is "indirect counts"; this is done by looking at the environment for signs of animal presence.Typically done by 
counting fecal matter or dens/nesting of a particular animal. This method is not as accurate as direct counting, but gives general 
counts of a population in a specific locale.
